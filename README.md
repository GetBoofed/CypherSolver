# CypherSolver
This is a quick and dirty cypher solver I made for my friend for the new MW2(2022) Raid mission. Run the launch file and follow the instructions on the command prompt that opens.

You must have Python installed for this to work. Here's the link. https://www.python.org/downloads/

I'm not a professional coder at all so there will be bugs and I'm sure someone could do this better. Sorry.
